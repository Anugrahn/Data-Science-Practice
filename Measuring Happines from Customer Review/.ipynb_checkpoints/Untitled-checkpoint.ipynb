      "Stayed here with husband and sons on the way to an Alaska Cruise. We all loved the hotel, great experience. Ask for a room on the North tower, facing north west for the best views. We had a high floor, with a stunning view of the needle, the city, and even the cruise ships! We ordered room service for dinner so we could enjoy the perfect views. Room service dinners were delicious, too! You are in a perfect spot to walk everywhere, so enjoy the city. Almost forgot- Heavenly beds were heavenly, too!\n",
      "========================\n",
      "Stayed at the Elan from --th to --th October and, as we liked it so much, returned there after our - day trip to Vegas for another - nights. Unassuming in appearance, the hotel scores heavily for its great location, spotlessly clean, classically designed and very comfortable bedrooms, and the friendliness of management and staff. Jorge and his colleagues on the front desk were a revelation with their untiring and enthusiastic help in recommending great restaurants, places to visit etc. And management were particularly helpful in letting us have a complimentary room post-check out to freshen up for our evening flight home after a long day enjoying the Southern Cal sunshine.\n",
      "========================\n",
      "My wife and spent - days there this month as a New York getaway vacation Christmas present to each other. Our stay overall was terrific. The quality, size, quietness, and location of the room was supurb. Every staff member was friendly and willing to help. Complimentary wine reception every evening was a definite plus. We felt comfortable from the moment we arrived and were reluctant to leave. The Muse is a calm oasis in the bustle of New York City. As a Kimpton InTouch member we were upgraded automatically to a superior king room. It was large well appointed and quiet with a view down --th street. The bed was extremely comfortable. They just began a complete renovation of the lobby so there may be some inconvenience until it is completed. Our only bad experience was the District Restaurant. We ate there Sunday for breakfast. Service was mediocre, the bacon and eggs were both overcooked and it was tremendously over priced. Such a fine hotel should not have such a bad restaurant. Other than that I would recommend this hotel very highly.\n",
      "========================\n",
      "Looking for a tranquil retreat in Denver that is close to great restaurants, shopping, the Botanic Gardens, the Art Museum in theCherry Creek neighborhood? This is the place!\n",
      "We had read about slow parking valet times, but our waits for the retrieval of our car averaged two minutes! I suppose if you wanted your car during intervals of high turnover (check-in and check-out), it might takelonger. I suggest you ask the valet staff if you are concerned.\n",
      "Back to the hotel room,we specified a room with mountain views and got a nice one. Large large bathroom with separate tub and bath appointed with marble floors and granite countertops. rooms facing west in the summer, you might want to leave your AC a little lower before you leave for dinner. Linens comfortable and pretty. The wallpaper was bold and dramatics...nice touch!\n",
      "Hope to return soon for another relaxing stay...eat and drink at North restaurant...-- steps from the front door of JW Marriott. You will not be disappointed!\n",
      "========================\n",
      "I'm not a fan of hotels so hate business travel but this hotel was a real pleasure. Fantastic pop-art style, enthusiastic staff, modest rooms with elegant 'pop' furnishings (I hate overstuffed rooms). Great location, though a little bit of a walk to nearest Metro station.\n",
      "========================\n",
      "Got a awesome rate here - $-- a night for a Radisson in NYC. Good location - about - blocks from Grand Central Station, about - blocks from Rockefeller Center. Away from the chaos and noise of Times Square but close enough to walk to sites and subway stops.\n",
      "Room was a good size, especially for NYC, desk, flat screen, - drawer dresser, closet with safe and our room had - twin beds. Both room and bathroom were clean. \n",
      "Negative is the windows are definitely not soundproof, had asked for a high floor and unfortunately didn't get one - was told it wasn't available but could ask again the next night. We heard all the noise -trash trucks, sounds outside, etc..honking, sirens. \n",
      "Other then not having soundproof windows, I would recommend staying here - nice place and nice location\n",
      "========================\n",
      "We spent - nights at the Sofitel Washington from Friday -------- to Tuesday --------. The check in process was speedy a most friendly. We made a special request at was accommodated without fuss or any attempt to collect extra fees. The staff is polite friendly and service was seamless. Our room booked through Expedia was clean and spacious with very nice amenities. The staff will always greet you with a friendly Bonjour or Bonsoir every time they see you... The Sofitel is a bit of Paris in DC! Very charming.\n",
      "========================\n",
      "The Good - The room was really just my taste. It was perfect. I don't know what else to say but that. The bed was very comfortable. What I loved the most was smelling the fresh sheets. I felt like I was in a laundry commercial. I could not stop smelling the fresh linens. The city view was perfect although I must say Philly skyline looks better in the day than night. Their free breakfast was really like a mini-buffet, notice I did not say continental. It was really huge, or at least larger than other hotel chain's continental breakfast. I don't eat pork and I was able to get cheese eggs. The free internet was crazy fast. Checking in and out was a breeze. The entire staff was very helpful and I would stay again. \n",
      "The Bad - I arrived -:-- (-- mins early) although check-in is -pm. I didn't mind the room was not ready then but was bothered that it was not ready until -:-- (-- mins late). The heater is not central based meaning you have to control it yourself and the vent was extremely loud. I opted many times to just not run it because it was just too loud to sit through. \n",
      "The Ugly - After coming in one night, there were people hanging out next to the elevator and wall with no shoes on. I assume they were maybe taking a break from their room however the hotel does have a lobby for that. It was not a good site to see shoe-less guests hanging out on the wall and at the elevator. On my last night, I was awaken at -am by rude guest who had been [--] the entire trip. After going back to sleep, I was then awaken by hammering. The hotel is renovating a little. I was also charged for local calls after being told they were free. During check-out, I told the front desk and was given not only a free room for the hammering but no charge for the local calls.\n",
      "========================\n",
      "The staff was SO GREAT! I travel a lot and have never had a staff be so friendly and helpful. I actually changed my room - times and they were great about it. My first room was on the -- floor (too high for me), then I went to the --th floor (the electrical outlets didn't work in the bathroom, and then I was in ----, GREAT room!!!! Fabulous location!!!\n",
      "========================\n",
      "I am told that John Dillinger once robbed this place when it was a bank. It is certainly historical and projects an image out of the ----s. The hotel is clean and comfortable with good service and an excellent breakfast. The hosts will make you feel at home in a better than average Hilton Garden Inn.\n",
      "There are two issues: There are only four ---minute unloading parking places in front and you have to fight the cabbies and then the valet parkers to get one, even for a moment. The valet people shamelessly hustle tips and will demand that you move if they are not paid off. Self parking (recommended) is in a garage just --- feet south on the west side of Pennsylvania Ave. You can pull a ticket there and then have it validated at the hotel. The second issue is that the blackout curtains are an inch too short now that new windows are installed. This means east-facing rooms learn about sunrise about -- seconds after it happens.\n",
